            At TGA we have a specialization course at the end of year two. In this course we got to pick a subject to
            specialize in and learn more about.
            <br><br>I chose to make a system that lets you destoy holes in a small cabin to then let new objects thrown
            at it also pass trough seemlessly.
            <br><br>In this project i had to overcome a lot of challenges, one of the biggest being how the physics
            system is suppose to just let through objects when it goes into contact with the hole.

            <b>How?</b>
        </div>

        <div class="specialization-text">
            There are many ways you can do this, one of the more popular being, let through the object in question if it
            collides with a trigger with the specified tag or layer.
            <br><br>This solution comes with a few problems, one being the performance of the process from contact to
            let through. The object first checks if it collides with the trigger, if it does then check if it is inside
            the object the hole is attached to. This makes two operations that should be able to be done in just one.
            <br><br>There is another problem, the object will disable its collider right when it touches the trigger and
            you will fall right through the mesh on the edge of the hole wich just wont look right like the image to the
            right.

            <b>Better solution</b>
        </div>

        <div class="specialization-text">
            We are able to the above in just one step. this is by using physx effective onContactModify, a built in
            physx collision modifier.
            The onContactModify is an overide function you can supply physx to directly be able to modify how physx
            handles collisions,
            so instead of checking trigger then let through we can let through the collider right when it finds a
            contact point inside a shape where collisions should be ignored.
            <br><br>Not only do we only use one operation per collision check, the collisions are also more accurate
            with only letting the actual contact points through.
            Because we know what two objects collide, we can then optimise the whole process by only checking if there
            are holes attached to the collider we touched.
            <br><br>After we know the contact point is inside a hole then we tell the point with setSeparation() that
            from the one point to the other has a distance of 1,
            which means no contact and thus keep moving.

        <div class="specialization-text">
            Now we have the "Hard part" over, the physics. The phyiscs works well and if we hover the sphere over some
            objects, chests in this case, they fall through the ground.
            To the right we have an example of what the result of oncontact modify gave.

        </div>

        <div class="specialization-text">
            <br><br>Next step is actually making a visual cut in the mesh. A way to do this is by using stencil testing
            plus layers to only write color where there are no holes.
            <br>This was quite easy to do in both DirectX11 and OpenGL.

        <div class="specialization-text">
            Now we have both the physics part done and the visulization that there is a hole.
            Now the last part was just making a demo where you throw balls at a cabin to break holes in it.
            This was simple, every time you click create a ball at the cameras position and add a velocity to it.
            When it detects a collision you add a cylinder mesh that has the remove layer set.

            <b>Closing Thoughts</b>
        </div>
        <div class="specialization-text" style="width: 100%;">
            The development of this project has been a interesting ride. I have learned alot about how to use stencil states and what cool effects these can give.
            The final product is not perfect and still has some bugs that was not squashed, one visual example is sometimes when you throw a ball it collides with the wall even if there's a hole there.
            First implementation was using DirectX11 using my own engine that i built from the ground up and made during a course at TGA. 
            This was my first graphical programming experience, i did not know alot about optimising the rendering pipeline and thus resulting in pretty bad fps around 150 at just a 10 objects.
            With the specialization course i decided to rewerite my entire engine in OpenGL, it was no small feat but i got it done. In the new version i get around 150 fps with 1000 objects.
            Theres is still much to be desired but its a learning experience. I am still very proud of what i acomplished in the amount of time i had, around 8 weeks at 50% speed.
