            Hole-é-mole was the second game project i participated in at The Game Assembly, it was a moblie game made in Unity. The main feature i created for Hole-é-mole was the moving platforms that moves creatures and the mole around.
            These platforms can be activated by going to a lever and interacting with it or walking onto a pressure plate. How i made it was when the platform is suppose to move it shoots a raycast upwards and check all objects on the current node to move.
            This works well and all but in heind sight i would instead just get what is standing on the platform since that is a function we had and could use easily. This could have improved performance and stability if the ray somehow misses.
            It was only a smaler game so not necessary to change but fun to think about.

            When it came to main menu's in games, i hate when they are always the same boring static no moving things so i wanted to mix things up. I have always loved 3D main menus cause they look awsome and are quite easy to implement for a developer.
            This also removes a bit of work for the graphics team since they always have a lot on their plates this helped them as well. The main menu is setup so that there is a gameobject in the middle of the four options in main menu.
            When you swipe to the left or right this object rotates bepending on your swipe direction, so it becomes a revolving wheel of sorts. I also added some torches to the background to give it some ambience.
            The menu turned out very well and is one of the best menus i've made till now.

            When it came to level select that needed to be implemented, i had a very good idea so i took the task.
            The idea was because we are going through a cave system and going further and further down, it will be a tressuremap kind of thing that goes deeper and deeper on your screen.
            It was easy to implement, all that was needed was tracking how much you scroll and move the backdrop with that amount.
            Since the background image is a gameobject all the colliders for entering levels move with it.

            This was my first time developing a game for mobile and it was a great experience, i got to learn more about optimisation for phone since its not as powerful as a pc.
            The game itself is a fun puzzle game to play, and was even more fun to make it.
