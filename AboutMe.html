    <div class="about-me-text">
        I'm Simon Henriksson, an Engine & Physics programmer. I am currently studying at The Game Assembly - Malmö in
        Higher Vocational Education - Game Programming. The Game Assembly is a Game Development school.
        <br>I am apassionate game developer with my sights set on making awesome and innovative games.
        I love to experiment with new programs, languages and API's, I recreated my own engine in OpenGL just to try the
        new graphics API and what it could do. I've been making games for more than 6 years, but have been fascinated and
        loved games ever since I got introduced to them as a youngen.
