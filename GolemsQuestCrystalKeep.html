        Golems Quest: Crystal Keep
    </a>


    <br>The main thing i made in this project and had the most impact was the shadows, this was very fun and i learned alot from this.
    <br>I created the specilised shaders like the enemy damage shader to make more cracks depending on the health the enemy has left.
