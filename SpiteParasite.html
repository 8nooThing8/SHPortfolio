            As per our specifications for this project we had to use unreal as our level editor and export them into our own engine TRK.
            At first only one person started working on the exporter but there was so much trubble, especially the rotations.
            The main problem was becaused of how unreal uses both a right hand coordinate system and use Z as up, compare that to our engine, we use a left hand coordinatesystem and Y is up so the completely oposite.
            After all the problem me and another programer jumped onto the task as well.
            We almost solved the rotations by instead of before we exported the transformation matrix directly from unreal now export all position, scale and rotation by themselfs.
            I decided to try to change the rotation order from ZYX to ZXY and that made things actually rotate corectly and after around a month we had the correct roations, it was such a relief.

        <div class="contribution-text">
            In this project there was no must for an extern physics system to be implemented but because we did need everything such system has i decided that this was what i was going to sit with and work on.
            This is where i first learned to use CMAKE, physx uses cmake to make a file to be able to build the physics library with your wanted specifications. with the finished library i started experimenting and made some small physics simulations that one could toy around with.

            Currently the gif above is just using rigidbody but we in the group found out physx has a implementation of a character controller to help objects go nicely up stairs or slopes which solves alot of physic related problems later.
            This worked well and as we thought it would, there was another problem with rotations from unreal but this time it was collider related. When i imported the colliders everything was global, i did not think about bluprints that will make child positions.
            This was easily solved by just multiplying the object transform matrix to the collider and it was solved.

            <br>
            <br>

            There was one thing that i did that was not the smartest, i rebuilt the physics system around 2 weeks before the due date. I have learned why this is such a bad idéa and have learned alot from that mistake.
            The rebuild was necessary since the before was just a temporary implementation. the problem was the timeframe, i should have kept the files and replaced them when we had more time.

            <br>
            <br>

            The old implementation used rigidbodies as both a rigidbody and a collider and if you just wanted a collider you would make a static rigid body. Now in the new system we have actual, box, capsule, sphere and mesh colliders and then if you want a rigidbody there is a separate component for that.

            <b>Player Attacks</b>
        </div>

        <div class="contribution-text-moving-platform">
            We had two different implementations of player attacks and this was first with the old physics system where we used colliders as attack radiuses as triggers and enable and disable them when you attack.
            This was not very stable and would only work half of the time, i then found out that physx only checks if obejct is inside a trigger if it was previously outside and the next frame is inside.
            The new way was the newest system which instead of using triggers and being janky we just use overlap geometry to directly check what is inside the shape instead of letting physx do it on the next frame.
            this also makes it more effectve because we only need to check triggers while the overlap shape is active.

            This was one of the more interesting projects i have worked on since we have done everything from scratch including the graphical programing we did not have to do in TGE.
            It was very fun and enjoyable and it was even better with
